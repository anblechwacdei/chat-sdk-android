- Chapter 9: Motors and Starters
- Chapter 10: Measuring Instruments and Meters
- Chapter 11: Lighting and Heating
- Chapter 12: Miscellaneous Examples

The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with diagrams and tables to illustrate the concepts. The examples are well-explained and cover a wide range of topics, such as circuits, networks, filters, resonance, power factor, three-phase systems, magnetic circuits, induction, synchronous machines, direct current machines, rectifiers, batteries, relays, switches, fuses, cables, lamps, heaters, etc. The book also provides answers to the examples at the end of each chapter.
 
Examples In Electrical Calculations By Admiralty is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about electrical calculations. It is a classic book that has been used by many generations of students and engineers. It is available online as a PDF file[^1^] [^2^] or as a hardcover book[^3^].
  
One of the advantages of Examples In Electrical Calculations By Admiralty is that it uses the metric system of units, which is more convenient and consistent than the imperial system. The book also explains the conversion factors and formulas for different units, such as ohms, volts, amperes, watts, joules, farads, henrys, etc. The book also provides tables of standard values and constants, such as resistivity, permittivity, permeability, etc.

Another advantage of Examples In Electrical Calculations By Admiralty is that it covers both theoretical and practical aspects of electrical engineering. The book not only teaches the principles and laws of electricity and magnetism, but also shows how they are applied in real-world situations and devices. The book also gives tips and tricks on how to solve electrical problems efficiently and accurately. The book also includes some historical and biographical notes on the pioneers and inventors of electrical engineering, such as Ohm, Kirchhoff, Faraday, Maxwell, Tesla, Edison, etc.
 
A possible drawback of Examples In Electrical Calculations By Admiralty is that it may be outdated in some aspects. The book was published in 1960 and may not reflect the latest developments and innovations in electrical engineering. The book may also contain some errors or typos that have not been corrected in later editions. The book may also use some terms or notations that are no longer in use or have different meanings today. Therefore, the reader should be careful and critical when using the book as a reference or a guide.
