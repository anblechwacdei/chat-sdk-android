## Step 1: Locate The Game Folder
 
The first thing you need to do is to find the folder where you have installed the game. This might vary depending on where you downloaded it from and where you chose to save it. However, a common location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Payday The Heist Repackl. If you can't find it there, you can use the Windows search function to look for "Payday The Heist Repackl" or "payday\_win32\_release.exe". Once you have located the game folder, open it.
 
## Step 2: Open The Language File
 
Inside the game folder, you will see a file called "language.txt". This is the file that determines the language of the game. You will need to open it with a text editor such as Notepad or WordPad. To do this, right-click on the file and select "Open with" and then choose your preferred text editor.
 
## Step 3: Change The Language Code
 
Once you have opened the language file, you will see a line that looks something like this:
 `language = english` 
This means that the game is set to English as the default language. To change it to another language, you will need to replace "english" with the code of your desired language. For example, if you want to change it to Spanish, you will need to write:
 `language = spanish` 
Here is a list of some of the available language codes:
 
- English: english
- Spanish: spanish
- French: french
- German: german
- Russian: russian
- Italian: italian
- Dutch: dutch
- Polish: polish
- Turkish: turkish
- Brazilian Portuguese: brazilian
- Simplified Chinese: schinese
- Traditional Chinese: tchinese
- Korean: koreana
- Japanese: japanese
- Thai: thai

If you don't see your preferred language in this list, you can try searching online for other possible codes.
 
## Step 4: Save And Close The File
 
After you have changed the language code, you will need to save and close the file. To do this, click on "File" and then "Save" or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S. Then close the text editor window.
