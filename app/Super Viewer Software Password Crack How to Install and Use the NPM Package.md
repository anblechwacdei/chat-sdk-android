## List of Popular Password Cracking Tools
 
There are many password cracking tools available online, but not all of them are reliable or effective. Here are some of the best password cracking tools that you can use to crack Super Viewer Software password:
 
- **CrackStation**: This is an online service that allows you to crack passwords by using a large database of pre-computed hashes. You just need to enter the hash of the password you want to crack and it will return the plain text password if it is found in the database. It supports various hashing algorithms, such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc. It is fast and easy to use, but it may not work for complex or uncommon passwords.[^1^]
- **Password Cracker**: This is a free software that can recover passwords from various applications, such as web browsers, email clients, FTP clients, etc. It can also reveal passwords hidden behind asterisks in dialog boxes or web pages. It works by scanning the memory of the running processes and extracting the passwords from there. It is simple and lightweight, but it may not support some newer applications or encryption methods.[^1^]
- **Brutus Password Cracker**: This is a software that can perform brute force attacks on remote servers or web applications. It can try different combinations of usernames and passwords until it finds a match. It supports various protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, POP3, etc. It also allows you to customize the attack parameters, such as character set, length range, timeout, etc. It is powerful and flexible, but it may take a long time to crack complex or long passwords.[^1^]
- **AirCrack**: This is a software that can crack wireless network passwords by capturing and analyzing network packets. It can perform various types of attacks, such as dictionary attack, brute force attack, WEP cracking, WPA/WPA2 cracking, etc. It supports various wireless cards and drivers and can work on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc. It is one of the most popular tools for hacking wireless networks, but it may require some technical skills and hardware compatibility.[^1^]
- **RainbowCrack**: This is a software that can crack passwords by using rainbow tables. Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables that contain the hashes and plain text passwords for a large number of possible combinations. By using rainbow tables, you can reduce the time and memory required for cracking passwords. However, you also need to download or generate large files of rainbow tables for different hashing algorithms and character sets.[^1^]
