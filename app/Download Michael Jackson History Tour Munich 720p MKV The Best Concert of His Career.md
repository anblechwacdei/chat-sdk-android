The concert also included some of Jackson's classic hits such as "Billie Jean", "Beat It", "Thriller", "Black or White" and "Smooth Criminal". The concert ended with an emotional rendition of "Heal the World", a humanitarian anthem that expressed Jackson's hope for a better future.

The History Tour in Munich was also a historic event for Jackson's personal life, as it marked the first public appearance of his son Prince Michael Jackson I, who was born in February 1997. Jackson introduced his son to the audience during "I'll Be There", a song he originally performed with his brothers as part of The Jackson 5. Jackson held his son in his arms and kissed him on the forehead, showing his love and affection for his first-born child.
 
The concert was also a demonstration of Jackson's humanitarian efforts, as he donated the proceeds from the show to the charity organization "Nelson Mandela Children's Fund". The charity was founded by the former South African president and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela, who was a close friend and admirer of Jackson. The charity aimed to improve the lives of children and youth in South Africa and other African countries. Jackson also met with Mandela before the concert and presented him with a check for $1 million.

The concert showcased his artistic genius, his passion for music and his dedication to his fans. The concert also revealed his human side, his fatherly love and his compassion for others.
