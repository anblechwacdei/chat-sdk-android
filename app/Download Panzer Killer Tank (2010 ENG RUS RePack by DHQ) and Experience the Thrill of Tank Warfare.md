## Panzer Killer: Tank - How to Play and Win
 
Now that you have downloaded Panzer Killer: Tank, you might be wondering how to play and win this game. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you master the game and defeat the enemy forces.
 
- The game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. You can choose the level that suits your skill and preference. The higher the difficulty, the more challenging the missions and the smarter the enemy AI.
- The game has two main game modes: campaign and quick battle. In campaign mode, you have to complete a series of missions that follow a storyline. You can unlock new tanks and weapons as you progress. In quick battle mode, you can choose any mission, tank, and weapon that you have unlocked and play it as many times as you want.
- The game also has a multiplayer mode where you can play with or against other players online. You can join or create a server and choose from different game modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, or king of the hill. You can also chat with other players using the built-in voice chat feature.
- The game controls are easy to use and customizable. You can use the keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to control your tank. You can also adjust the sensitivity, invert the axis, and change the key bindings in the options menu.
- The game has a realistic damage system that affects your tank's performance and appearance. Your tank can take damage from enemy fire, mines, explosions, collisions, or environmental hazards. You can see your tank's health bar on the lower left corner of the screen. If your health bar reaches zero, your tank will explode and you will lose the mission.
- You can repair your tank by finding repair kits scattered around the map or by driving over friendly repair trucks. You can also replenish your ammo by finding ammo crates or by driving over friendly ammo trucks. You can see your ammo count on the lower right corner of the screen.
- You can use different weapons to attack your enemies depending on the situation. You have a main cannon that fires shells that can penetrate armor and cause heavy damage. You also have a machine gun that fires bullets that can damage soft targets and suppress enemy fire. You can switch between these weapons by pressing the spacebar or the right trigger on your gamepad.
- You can also use special weapons that have limited ammo but offer more firepower and variety. You can unlock these weapons by completing missions or finding them on the map. Some of these weapons include rockets, grenades, flamethrowers, mines, smoke screens, and air strikes. You can select these weapons by pressing the number keys or the D-pad on your gamepad.
- You can use different tactics to outsmart and outmaneuver your enemies depending on the terrain and the mission objectives. You can use cover, stealth, flanking, ambushes, diversions, or teamwork to gain an advantage over your foes. You can also use your binoculars to scout ahead and spot enemies from a distance.
