- A new item: Aghanim's Shard, which can be purchased for 1400 gold and grants a special upgrade to one of the hero's abilities. Each hero has a different upgrade, some of which are exclusive to Dota Imba.
- A new mode: Overthrow, which is a fast-paced and chaotic game mode where teams compete to kill each other and collect coins that spawn around the map. The team with the most coins at the end of the match wins.
