The Mindray De Cg 03a uses a microprocessor-based circuit device called the Component 6-1807, which contains six independent inputs, called sources (1 to 6), which are often represented by the letters A to F. The sources can be connected to different sensors, such as photodiodes, electrodes, or transducers, to measure different parameters of the blood sample, such as impedance, optical density, voltage, or pressure. The Component 6-1807 then converts the signals from the sources into digital data and sends them to the main processor for analysis.
 
The Mindray De Cg 03a also has a manual transmission mode, which allows the user to manually adjust one or more settings from the operator interface of the diagnostic device. For example, the user can change the layout of the user interfaces, view the histogram of the target display, or calibrate the sensors. The manual transmission mode can be accessed by pressing the M key on the keyboard or selecting the M icon on the touch screen.
 
The Mindray De Cg 03a is a reliable and efficient haematology analyser that can provide accurate and comprehensive results for various blood tests. It is suitable for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and research institutes that need a high-performance and user-friendly device for haematology analysis.
