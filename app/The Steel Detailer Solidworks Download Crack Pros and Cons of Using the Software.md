If you are a SOLIDWORKS designer and need something to automate steel modeling and detailing, then you might want to check out The Steel Detailer (TSD), a Gold Partnered Structural Design and Detailing Addon to SOLIDWORKS[^1^]. TSD is designed and used by Quadro Design Pty Ltd in Perth, Western Australia, and it has been used by customers from all around the world to complete structural projects in the building and construction, mining and oil & gas industries[^1^].
 
With TSD, you can turn SOLIDWORKS into a structural application that offers many features and benefits, such as:

- Automated filing, bolted and cutting connections, detailing, project creation, BOM, consolidation of components, and document processes[^1^]
- Library management with various library models to reduce modeling times considerably[^1^]
- DSTV CNC NC1 export for SOLIDWORKS
- A task pane that provides a portal to your learning experience with tutorials and project samples[^2^]
- A 30-day free trial with a serial number to register your trial with their online server[^2^]

To install TSD, you will need to follow the installation help file exactly and make sure you have the following requirements:

- TSD 2015 works with SOLIDWORKS 2015 and TSD 2016 works with SOLIDWORKS 2016. It is recommended to only have one version of SOLIDWORKS installed[^2^]
- TSD has a Microsoft SQL Database back end. Microsoft SQL Express 2008 or higher is required. Both the express and full versions can be used. The SQL installation files are included with the deployment of TSD. When setting up the SQL database to an existing SQL instance, you must remember the 'sa' account password[^2^]

If you are interested in downloading and trying out TSD, you can visit their website at [^1^] or contact them at sales@thesteeldetailer.com for more information.
 
However, if you are looking for a crack version of TSD, I'm afraid I cannot help you with that. Downloading or using cracked software is illegal and unethical, and it may expose your computer to viruses or malware. It may also cause functional problems with SOLIDWORKS or TSD. I suggest you respect the intellectual property rights of the developers and use the official version of TSD instead.

As you can see, TSD is a powerful and useful add-on for structural steel detailing in SOLIDWORKS. But what are the benefits of steel detailing in general? Why is it important for the construction industry? Here are some of the advantages of steel detailing that you should know:

1. Increased productivity with fewer errors. You can avoid human errors in traditional drawings, such as incorrect measurements and formula miscalculations, by using structural steel detailing software. You can also save time and resources by automating tedious and repetitive tasks, such as creating connections, BOMs, and drawings[^3^].
2. Easy access. Unlike a diagram, itâs simple to manage and share a 3D model of the structure with all the stakeholders involved in the project. You can also access the design at any time and from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection and a compatible device[^3^].
3. Cost efficiency. By using steel detailing software, you can reduce the material wastage and optimize the fabrication process. You can also avoid costly errors and rework that may arise from inaccurate or incomplete drawings. You can also estimate the budget and schedule of the project more accurately by using the 3D model[^3^].
4. Enhanced presentation. A 3D model of the structure can help you visualize the design better and communicate your ideas more effectively to the client and other parties. You can also create realistic renderings and animations to showcase the features and benefits of your design[^3^].
5. Virtual reality integration. Some steel detailing software can integrate with virtual reality (VR) devices to create an immersive experience of the structure. You can use VR to inspect the design, identify potential issues, and make changes before fabrication and erection. You can also use VR to train the workers and improve their safety[^3^].

These are some of the benefits of steel detailing that you can enjoy by using TSD or other similar software. Steel detailing is a vital process that requires a high level of accuracy and skill. It is also a critical communication link that connects key professionals such as engineers, architects, contractors, fabricators, and erectors who are involved in the project at any level. By using steel detailing software, you can improve the quality, efficiency, and safety of your project.
